# To-do 26/10
- *Read files*
    - Celia: Read and write compressed and uncompressed files.
    

- *Quality scores*
    - Viktor: Recognizing the format - Phred 33 vs 64. 
    - Viktor: Function for translating ASCII characters in fastq files into numerical scores. Needed for trimming.
    
    
- *Trimming*
    - Celia: Remove leading and trailing bases, according to user input
    - Celia: Remove leading and trailing bases, if quality < threshold -- threshold default = 3
    - Celia: Sliding window algorithm for further trimming -- window size default = 4, quality threshold default = 15
    
    
- *Read filtering (simultaneously in both forward and reverse files)*
    - Remove reads when average quality < threshold -- threshold default = 15
    - Eliminate reads when length < threshold -- threshold default = 36bp
    

- *Statistics (flexible) -- check what trimmomatic output looks like*
    - Keep track of trimmed and removed reads.
    - Calculate statistics on a fastq/fasta file without trimming such as number of entries, number of bases, length of entries, average length of entries, quality (average, best/worst 10%), etc.
    - Same after trimming.
    
    
- *User input through command line -- with argparse library*
    - Allow user to specify:
        - Input and output files
        - Phred encoding type
        - Heading and trailing crops
        - Sliding window size and quality threshold
        - Minimum read length
